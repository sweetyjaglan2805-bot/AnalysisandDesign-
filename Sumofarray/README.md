# Analysis and Design

This repository contains programs and performance analysis for algorithms implemented in C++.

## Description
The project demonstrates algorithm analysis using recursion, random input generation, execution time measurement, and data visualization using Python.

## Files
- recursive_sum.cpp
- sum_table.txt
- sum_csv.txt
- plot_sum.py
- sum_graph.png

## How to Run
1. Compile the C++ program.
2. Run the program to generate output files.
3. Run the Python script to generate the graph.

## Output
The output includes a table of results and a graph showing execution time versus input size.
